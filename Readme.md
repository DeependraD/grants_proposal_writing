# Grants and proposal writing

This is a collection of my essays and scientific write-ups that seeks to answer some real-life questions through carefully designed studies.

I have a bunch of tips on how to do exactly that, too.

## Resources

1. First and foremost how does it sound like to have access to someelse's life long work of scientific writing -- knowing how he progressed over the years. Yaniv Brandvain's repo is exactly what this is about. visit: https://github.com/ybrandvain/GRFP for a very good resource.
2. Ross Ibarra's is another wonderful resource to go to. https://github.com/RILAB/statements
